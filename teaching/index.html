The Learning Assistant (LA) Program at UCLA allows undergraduates who have previously taken a course to facilitate 20-30 student discussion sections or labs alongside graduate student TAs and course instructors. LAs also learn about collaborative learning and inclusive pedagogy during our quarterly seminar and apply these skills in large introductory STEM courses. <a href="https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More about the LA program can be found on their website here.</a></p><hr><p>I LA'd for the following classes throughout my time at UCLA:</p><ul><li>Four sections of <strong>Physics 4BL</strong>: Electromagnetism Laboratory for Scientists &amp; Engineers [one quarter as <em>Logistics Head LA</em>]</li><li>One section of <strong>Physics 4AL</strong>: Mechanics Laboratory for Scientists &amp; Engineers [one quarter as <em>Pedagogy Head LA; one quarter as Logistics Head LA</em>]</li><li>Two sections of <strong>Physics 1C</strong>: Electrodynamics, Optics, and Special Relativity [one quarter as <em>Logistics Head LA</em>]</li><li>One section of <strong>Chemistry 113A</strong>: Quantum Chemistry</li></ul><hr><h3>Program Development Team</h3><p>During the 2021-2022 school year, I worked with Dr. Shanna Shaked, three graduate pedagogy seminar TAs, and 7 other experienced Head LAs in the Program Development Team as part of the <strong>Pedagogy</strong>, <strong>(Physical) Chemistry</strong>, and <strong>Social Media</strong> divisions. I directly managed 60+ pedagogy head LAs every quarter, proposed changes to streamline and enhance the quarterly pedagogy seminar, revamped the program's instagram, and maintained Javascript code on Google Forms to send feedback to 600+ LAs multiple times a quarter. I also helped expand the program to physical chemistry (Chem 20A/Chem 113A), biochemistry (Chem 153A), and earth science (EPSS 71/171) courses.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
