For years, these Japanese Americans — many of whom were American citizens — lived in these camps, with their loyalty to the United States government questioned at every minute. However, despite this mass incarceration and anti-Japanese sentiment, many Nisei volunteered or were drafted into the army, going on to valiantly serve in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the 100th Battalion, and the Military Intelligence Service (among others). In both the European and Pacific theaters, these Nisei men and women fought in the battlefields, most notably risking their lives in the Rescue of the Lost Battalion; served as nurses and medics; and used their Japanese language skills to provide crucial intelligence for the American army. </p><p>The <a href="https://goforbroke.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go For Broke National Education Center</a> is a non-profit located in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo that honors the Nisei veteran story. As the Getty Marrow Collections Intern in Summer 2022, I scanned and digitized submitted archival materials, including photo albums and documents, to add to the organization's digital collections. I also conducted heuristic analysis on the website's UX/UI and accessibility and piloted ArcGIS storymaps to revamp the website's history content. </p><h2>Final Project</h2><p>For my final project, I recorded the demographics and metadata for 900+ oral histories in the Hanashi Oral History Collection and visualized the data using Tableau and Voyant Tools. It was such a great opportunity to create a new dataset, clean the data, and visualize it all over the course of ten weeks! </p><p>Some of the visualizations can be found below!</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM-xs.png 300w, https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM-sm.png 480w, https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM-md.png 768w, https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM-lg.png 1024w, https://james-y-yoon.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-09-13-at-1.54.16-AM-xl.png 1360w" alt="Units represented in the Hanashi Oral History collection." width="1362" height="764"><figcaption>One of the data visualizations I created on Tableau showing the units represented in the Hanashi Oral History collection.
