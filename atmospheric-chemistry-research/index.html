I'm co-advised by <a href="https://alexjturner.github.io/">Dr. Alex Turner</a> and <a href="https://www.atmos.washington.edu/~thornton/">Dr. Joel Thornton</a>.</p><hr><p>Some of my primary research interests are:</p><h2>(1) <strong>Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound (BVOC)</strong> emissions</h2><p><strong>Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)</strong> are molecules emitted primarily by land plants that constitute a significant portion of the total hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere. <strong>Isoprene</strong>, which is the most significant BVOC by emissions, contributes around 500 Tg C/year into the atmosphere, which makes it the most important non-methane hydrocarbon on a global scale. Once in the atmosphere, BVOCs are quickly oxidized by the hydroxyl (OH) radical and can create significant amounts of organic aerosols and tropospheric ozone.</p><p>My interests are in<strong> quantifying these BVOC emissions and understanding what drives emissions</strong> through a combination of vegetation indices, isoprene satellite retrievals, and atmospheric modeling. Some of my preliminary work looks at how how isoprene columns vary with <strong>solar-induced fluoresence</strong>, as well as how isoprene drivers vary in tropical regions. Furthermore, I am interested in the remote sensing of BVOCs and constraining isoprene retrievals with large-eddy simulations and 3D atmospheric models (GEOS-Chem).</p><h2>(2) Natural drivers of OH variability</h2><p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that traps more infrared radiation on a per-molecule basis compared to carbon dioxide. However, unlike carbon dioxide, which is chemically unreactive when emitted, methane breaks down within 9-12 years through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). OH, often called the detergent of the atmosphere, is difficult to model, as it is produced and lost via chemical reactions (rather than direct emissions), only has a lifetime of around 1 second and cannot be detected directly through satellites. As a result, there is quite a bit of uncertainty in how much OH is present in models and how it may impact how quickly other compounds degrade, including methane.</p><p>I am most interested in how natural hydrocarbon and NOx sources, namely isoprene and soil/biomass burning NOx, affects local and global OH concentrations. To do this, I use isoprene and NOx satellite retrievals and global atmospheric modeling to study how OH concentrations, and thus how methane lifetimes, change with different isoprene and NOx sources. Similarly, I'm also interested in biogenic methane emissions from wetlands, which also affects OH concentrations on interannual timescales.</p><h2>(3) Oceanic organics</h2><p>The ocean contributes to atmospheric chemistry through both organic and inorganic emissions. Oceanic isoprene from phytoplankton blooms could contribute ~2 Tg C/year, which may not be important on a global scale but could affect marine and coastal chemistry and air quality.Â </p><p>I am most interested in marine isoprene emissions: what controls isoprene emissions, phytoplankton emission factors, and the impact of blooms on organic emissions and local atmospheric chemistry.</p><hr><h3>Past Research</h3><p>Prior to coming to the University of Washington, I worked with Dr. Stan Sander and Dr. Zhao-Cheng Zeng on JPL's CLARS-FTS (Fourier-Transform infrared Spectrometer at the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing) instrument on Mt. Wilson, California. My project investigated <strong>high methane events during the 2015-2016 Aliso Canyon leak</strong> in Porter Ranch; I then extend the methodology to identify other potentially high methane events throughout the entire CLARS-FTS dataset (2011-2021). A paper on these high methane events is currently in the works.</p><p>Finally, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/stutz-group/team-members?authuser=0">Stutz Lab</a> at UCLA's Department of Atmospheric &amp; Oceanic Sciences studying <strong>how nitrous acid (HONO) chemistry is affected by turbulent vertical mixing in the lowest 10 meters</strong>. I used the group's PACT-1D model to quantify how sensitive certain HONO surface production processes are to changes in eddy diffusivity coefficients (Kz).</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION]"><svg><use xlink:href="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=6450cfc483efd7e58ed8ad5b64050d3e"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
