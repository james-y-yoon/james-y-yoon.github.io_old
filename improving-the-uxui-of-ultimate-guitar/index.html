Armed with my music theory knowledge from piano lessons, I scrolled through tablatures and supplemented my playing with the occassional YouTube video. However, no service was as crucial as Ultimate-Guitar in my guitar learning journey. By learning just a couple of chords in an evening, I was able to play along to some of my favorite songs: the latest pop hits, radio throwbacks, and the occassional classical piece.</p><p>This UX/UI project, completed with Dr. Sookie Cho's guidance in UCLA's Digital Humanities 110 UX course, aimed to improve Ultimate-Guitar's user interface, focusing on a target audience of middle-aged, male guitar learners of all skill levels. </p><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><blockquote><p>For this project, I identified the issues to be a non-intuitive labeling (using "Shots" instead of "Videos"), overall design clutter, and lack of flexibility or features like annotation. Overall, this website seemed tailored to long-term users and advanced guitar players, thus excluding a significant portion of their potential userbase.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><p>The design journey consisted of heuristic analysis of the current Ultimate-Guitar website and a competitor, followed by a usability test of the current site to identify any potential flaws. I then researched UX improvements through an interview and a ethnography and used these findings to guide my personas and UX storytelling. I then designed a low-fidelity prototype and interface based on the personas I created, testing them through a cognitive walkthrough with my peers. Finally, I polished my high-fidelity prototype and conducted four usability tests with my target audience to identify more opportunities for future improvement. </p></div></div><p><a href="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/DH110-JamesYoon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can explore the design journey and the final prototype here</a>! </p><h1>Special Thanks</h1><p>Huge thanks to Sookie Cho and the rest of the DH 110 course for all of their help and reviews!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/tags/digital-humanities/">Digital Humanities</a></li><li><a href="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/tags/uxui/">UX/UI</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://james-y-yoon.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
